# Project Brief: Local Scanner MCP Server

## Project Overview
The Local Scanner MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed to provide tools for scanning and analyzing local code and localhost URLs. It enables AI assistants to interact with local web applications, validate code, and capture screenshots through a standardized protocol.

## Core Requirements

1. **Localhost URL Scanning**
   - Access localhost URLs to capture console logs and runtime errors
   - Perform actions on web pages (clicking, typing, waiting)
   - Take screenshots of localhost URLs

2. **Code Analysis**
   - Lint JavaScript, TypeScript, and CSS files
   - Validate HTML content for standards compliance

3. **MCP Protocol Implementation**
   - Implement the Model Context Protocol for standardized communication
   - Provide well-defined tools with clear input schemas
   - Handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback

## Project Goals

1. **Enable AI Assistants to Test Web Applications**
   - Allow AI to interact with locally running web applications
   - Provide visual feedback through screenshots
   - Capture console logs and errors for debugging

2. **Improve Code Quality**
   - Validate code against established standards
   - Identify potential issues in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/TypeScript

3. **Simplify Integration**
   - Provide a standardized interface through MCP
   - Make it easy to configure and use with MCP clients

## Success Criteria

1. The server successfully implements all required tools (scan_localhost, screenshot_localhost, lint_code, validate_html)
2. Tools provide accurate and useful information
3. The server handles errors gracefully
4. Documentation clearly explains how to use the server and its tools
5. Example code demonstrates practical usage scenarios

## Constraints

1. The server must only access localhost URLs for security reasons
2. The server must run as a command-line application
3. The server must implement the Model Context Protocol specification
