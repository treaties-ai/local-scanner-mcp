## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Design Decisions

1. **Tool Selection**
   - Decision: Focus on four core tools (scan_localhost, screenshot_localhost, lint_code, validate_html)
   - Rationale: These tools cover the most common use cases for local development assistance
   - Status: Implemented successfully

2. **Technology Choices**
   - Decision: Use TypeScript, Puppeteer, ESLint, Stylelint, and html-validator
   - Rationale: Industry-standard tools with good documentation and community support
   - Status: Working well, providing robust functionality

3. **MCP Implementation**
   - Decision: Use the official MCP SDK
   - Rationale: Ensures compatibility and reduces implementation complexity
   - Status: Successfully integrated

### Refinements

1. **Input Validation**
   - Initial Approach: Basic type checking
   - Refinement: TypeScript type predicates for runtime validation
   - Outcome: More robust validation with better type safety

2. **Error Handling**
   - Initial Approach: Simple error messages
   - Refinement: Structured error responses with context
   - Outcome: More informative error reporting for users

3. **Browser Automation**
   - Initial Approach: Basic page loading
   - Refinement: Added interaction capabilities and console logging
   - Outcome: More powerful and flexible tool for web application testing

### Future Directions

1. **Tool Expansion**
   - Current State: Four core tools implemented
   - Future Direction: Add more specialized tools for specific development tasks
   - Rationale: Expand utility while maintaining focus on local development

2. **Configuration Flexibility**
   - Current State: Limited configuration options
   - Future Direction: More customizable tools with external configuration
   - Rationale: Better adaptability to different project needs

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Current State: Functional but with room for performance improvements
   - Future Direction: Optimize resource usage and response times
   - Rationale: Better user experience, especially for resource-intensive operations

## Known Issues

1. **Browser Resource Usage**
   - Issue: Puppeteer instances can be resource-intensive
   - Impact: May cause performance issues on systems with limited resources
   - Potential Solution: Browser instance pooling and better resource management

2. **Linting Configuration**
   - Issue: Limited customization of linting rules
   - Impact: May not match project-specific linting preferences
   - Potential Solution: Support for external linting configuration files

3. **Error Verbosity**
   - Issue: Some error messages could be more descriptive
   - Impact: May make troubleshooting more difficult
   - Potential Solution: Enhanced error context and troubleshooting guidance

4. **HTML Validation Limitations**
   - Issue: HTML validation is basic and lacks customization
   - Impact: May not catch project-specific HTML issues
   - Potential Solution: Custom validation rules and more comprehensive checking
