# Active Context: Local Scanner MCP Server

## Current Work Focus

The Local Scanner MCP Server is currently in a stable state with all core functionality implemented. The server provides four main tools:

1. **scan_localhost** - For accessing localhost URLs, capturing console logs, and checking for runtime errors
2. **screenshot_localhost** - For taking screenshots of localhost URLs
3. **lint_code** - For linting JavaScript, TypeScript, and CSS files
4. **validate_html** - For validating HTML content against standards

The current focus is on:

1. **Documentation and examples** - Ensuring comprehensive documentation and examples for users
2. **Testing and stability** - Verifying all tools work correctly in various scenarios
3. **Integration with MCP clients** - Making sure the server works seamlessly with different MCP clients

## Recent Changes

- Implemented all four core tools with proper input validation
- Added comprehensive error handling for each tool
- Created example files demonstrating usage patterns
- Added configuration examples for MCP clients
- Implemented test server for local testing

## Next Steps

### Short-term Tasks

1. **Enhanced Error Reporting**
   - Improve error messages to be more descriptive and actionable
   - Add more context to validation errors

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize browser instance management for faster response times
   - Consider adding caching for repeated linting operations

3. **Additional Examples**
   - Create more complex examples showing real-world usage scenarios
   - Add examples for different frameworks and libraries

### Medium-term Goals

1. **Additional Tools**
   - Add support for more linting tools (e.g., for other languages)
   - Implement network request monitoring for localhost URLs
   - Add accessibility testing capabilities

2. **Configuration Options**
   - Allow customization of linting rules
   - Support for custom HTML validation rules
   - Enable configuration of browser settings

3. **Integration Improvements**
   - Better integration with development workflows
   - Support for CI/CD environments

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Security Considerations

- **URL Restrictions**: Maintaining strict validation of localhost URLs to prevent security issues
- **File Access**: Ensuring file access is properly restricted to prevent unauthorized access
- **Error Exposure**: Balancing informative error messages with security concerns

### Performance Tradeoffs

- **Browser Instances**: Currently creating and destroying browser instances for each request for isolation, but considering pooling for performance
- **Validation Depth**: Balancing thorough validation with performance impact
- **Response Size**: Managing screenshot size and detail level for efficient communication

### User Experience

- **Tool Discoverability**: Making tools and their capabilities easily discoverable by MCP clients
- **Result Formatting**: Ensuring results are formatted in a way that's easy for AI assistants to interpret
- **Error Handling**: Providing clear, actionable error messages that help users resolve issues

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Style

- **TypeScript Usage**: Leveraging TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- **Async/Await**: Using async/await for asynchronous operations for readability
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling patterns with informative messages
- **Input Validation**: Thorough validation of all inputs before processing

### Tool Design Principles

1. **Clear Purpose**: Each tool has a single, well-defined purpose
2. **Comprehensive Validation**: All inputs are validated before processing
3. **Graceful Error Handling**: Tools handle errors gracefully and provide useful feedback
4. **Consistent Response Format**: All tools return results in a consistent format

### Documentation Approach

- **Schema Documentation**: Clear documentation of input schemas for each tool
- **Example-Driven**: Providing concrete examples for each tool and use case
- **Visual Aids**: Using diagrams and screenshots where appropriate

## Learnings and Project Insights

### What's Working Well

- The MCP SDK provides a solid foundation for building MCP servers
- Puppeteer is effective for browser automation and screenshot capture
- The command pattern for tool implementation provides good separation of concerns
- TypeScript type predicates are effective for runtime validation

### Challenges and Solutions

- **Browser Automation Complexity**: Puppeteer operations can be complex; simplified through facade pattern
- **Error Handling Across Tools**: Standardized error handling approach for consistency
- **Input Validation**: Type predicates provide both runtime validation and TypeScript type safety
- **MCP Protocol Understanding**: Documentation and examples help clarify protocol usage

### Integration Insights

- MCP clients need clear documentation on server capabilities
- Example configurations help users get started quickly
- Test servers and examples demonstrate practical usage
- Real-world testing with different MCP clients is essential for compatibility
