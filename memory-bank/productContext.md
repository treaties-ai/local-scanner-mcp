# Product Context: Local Scanner MCP Server

## Problem Statement

AI assistants are increasingly capable of helping with software development tasks, but they face significant limitations when it comes to interacting with locally running applications and analyzing local code. This creates a gap in their ability to provide comprehensive assistance for web development workflows.

Specific challenges include:

1. **Limited visibility into local web applications**
   - AI assistants cannot directly access or view localhost URLs
   - They cannot observe runtime behavior, console logs, or errors
   - They cannot interact with web interfaces to test functionality

2. **Restricted code analysis capabilities**
   - AI assistants cannot directly run linters or validators on local code
   - They cannot verify HTML standards compliance
   - They lack tools to analyze code quality in real-time

3. **Integration complexity**
   - Developers need a standardized way for AI to interact with local environments
   - Custom solutions are often fragmented and lack consistency
   - There's no common protocol for these interactions

## Solution

The Local Scanner MCP Server bridges these gaps by providing a standardized interface through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that enables AI assistants to:

1. **Interact with local web applications**
   - Access localhost URLs to observe behavior
   - Capture screenshots for visual context
   - Collect console logs and runtime errors
   - Perform actions like clicking buttons and filling forms

2. **Analyze local code**
   - Lint JavaScript, TypeScript, and CSS files
   - Validate HTML against standards
   - Identify potential issues and improvements

3. **Integrate seamlessly**
   - Use a consistent protocol (MCP) for all interactions
   - Provide clear input/output schemas
   - Work with any MCP-compatible AI assistant

## User Experience Goals

### For Developers

1. **Simplified debugging assistance**
   - Get AI help with identifying and fixing issues in local web applications
   - Share visual context without manual screenshot taking
   - Allow AI to observe runtime behavior directly

2. **Improved code quality**
   - Receive AI suggestions based on actual linting results
   - Get standards compliance feedback for HTML
   - Identify potential issues before committing code

3. **Streamlined workflow**
   - Reduce context switching between AI and local development
   - Enable AI to test changes in real-time
   - Create a more integrated development experience

### For AI Assistants

1. **Enhanced capabilities**
   - Gain ability to interact with local web applications
   - Access real-time information about code quality
   - Provide more accurate and contextual assistance

2. **Better context**
   - See visual representation of web applications
   - Access console logs and runtime errors
   - Understand how code behaves in practice

3. **Standardized interface**
   - Use consistent tools across different projects
   - Rely on well-defined schemas for interactions
   - Provide more reliable assistance

## Target Users

1. **Web developers** who want AI assistance with:
   - Debugging local web applications
   - Improving code quality
   - Testing user interfaces
   - Validating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/TypeScript

2. **AI assistants** that implement the Model Context Protocol and need to:
   - Interact with localhost URLs
   - Analyze local code
   - Provide visual context
   - Test web application functionality
